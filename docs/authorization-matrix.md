# Authorization matrix

This matrix is the Phase 1 runtime contract. `—` means no Edge route, role, scope, or service key is applicable. A human JWT includes administrators unless a row explicitly requires the `admin` role. The default rule is: an agent is denied unless the row names an explicit scope.

Cross-user resources remain concealed with `404`; authentication failures use the endpoint's existing `401`/`403` convention. Service-key endpoints do not trust Bearer identity and compare `X-Service-Key` in constant time.
